# NLPDEMO: Natural Language Processing Hands-On Project
## Intruduction
This project is a hands-on demo of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, organized in modular Python scripts. It walks through fundamental concepts such as preprocessing, normalization, text classification, lemmatization, different NLP model approaches, and more.

## NLP Concepts
1. What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate natural language in a way that is meaningful. NLP encompasses tasks such as translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and more.

2. What are the main challenges in NLP?

4. What are some common preprocessing techniques used in NLP?
    - Tokenization: Splitting text into words or phrases.

    - Stop Word Removal: Removing common, less informative words.

    - Text Normalization:

        - Lowercasing

        - Lemmatization

        - Stemming

        - Date/Time normalization

    - Punctuation/Special Character Removal

    - HTML Tag Removal

    - Spell Correction

    - Sentence Segmentation
